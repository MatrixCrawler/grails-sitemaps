Grails Sitemaps
=====================
The grails sitemaps plugin provides a common interface for building out sitemaps. This supports generating sitemaps both in a single application environment as well as a plugin heavy environment.
You can simply create Sitemap classes in the `grails-app/sitemaps` folder and your good to go.
